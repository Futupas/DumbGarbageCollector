# DumbGarbageCollector

Very basic and dumb "garbage collector" for C that allows not to care (almost) about proper allocs and frees

Very dumb garbage collector. It just stores all the pointers, and allows to free them all not caring about forgotten pointers.

If you use this, DON'T USE default calloc/malloc/realloc/free. Use only the given ones.

In case of error free all of YOUR resources, and call `dgc_free_all`.

Before exit also don't forget to call `dgc_free_all`.

Be careful: any method can return NULL, it does not free the memory in case of error.

This is not very performance-efficient as it uses LinkedList, so if you are going to reallocate/free pointers a lot (calloc/malloc don't affect it), be careful.

Also it doesn't handle some edge cases (cyclic references etc), it's a very basic implementation.

## Usage example

You can find it in [main.c](https://github.com/Futupas/DumbGarbageCollector/blob/main/main.c)

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#include "dumb_garbage_collector.h"

// Usage example

int main(void)
{
    // Init DGC
    struct dumb_gc* dgc = dgc_init();

    // CAlloc example
    int32_t* ints1 = dgc_calloc(dgc, sizeof(int32_t), 100);
    printf("CAlloc: %d, %d\n", ints1[4], ints1[20]);

    // MAlloc example
    int32_t* ints2 = dgc_malloc(dgc, sizeof(int32_t) * 100);
    ints2[4] = 6;
    ints2[20] = 9;
    printf("MAlloc: %d, %d\n", ints2[4], ints2[20]);

    // Free example
    ints2 = dgc_free(dgc, ints2);
    printf("Ints2 (freed): %p\n", (void*)ints2);

    // ReAlloc example
    ints1 = dgc_realloc(dgc, ints1, sizeof(int32_t) * 200);
    if (ints1 == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error reallocating memory\n");
        // Don't forget to free the resources!
        dgc_free_all(dgc);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    ints1[104] = 6;
    ints1[120] = 9;
    printf("ReAlloc: %d, %d\n", ints1[104], ints1[120]);

    // Final free
    dgc_free_all(dgc);

    printf("All resources are freed\n");

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
